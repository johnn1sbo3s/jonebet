# Issue tracker: Local Markdown (centralized at parent)

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/` **at the JoneBet parent**
(`Projetos/jonebet/.scratch/`), shared with the other two repos (`jonebet-api`,
`momentum-scanner`), because agent sessions normally open at the parent, not inside a single repo.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (at the parent)
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Each ticket names its repo in a `Repo:` line near the top (`frontend` for this repo, `api`, or `scanner`)
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` at the parent (creating the directory if needed).
From this repo, that path is `../.scratch/`. Never create a per-repo `.scratch/` here;
there is exactly one tracker, at the parent.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket (all at the parent).

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
