# 📊 [DataPlay Bets](https://dataplaybets.vercel.app/) (Frontend)

This is the **frontend project** for the DataPlay Bets system — a personal side project focused on data-driven betting strategies.

The frontend is built with **Vue.js**, and its main role is to **visualize the results** generated by the backend logic (developed separately in Python, in a private repository).  

## 💡 Features

- Responsive UI to explore betting results
- Displays stake suggestions and outcomes
- Built for personal research and experimentation

## 🛠️ Technologies

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## 📌 Notes

- This repo **does not contain the AI/ML backend logic** — that part is kept private.
- This project is part of an ongoing exploration of applying machine learning to betting models.

## 🚧 To Do

- Improve data visualization
- Add charts and breakdowns by match/event
- Light mode toggle

Created as part of my curiosity for automation, data, and how AI can help us make smarter decisions, even in unexpected domains like betting.
